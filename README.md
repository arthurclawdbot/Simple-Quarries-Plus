- **Item Overflow Protection**: Extra items drop above the quarry if inventory is full

## 📖 How to Use

### Basic Setup
1. Craft a Quarry block and place it where you want to mine
2. Right-click to open the quarry interface
3. Insert a pickaxe in the top-left slot
4. Add fuel to the slot below the pickaxe
5. The quarry will begin mining and storing blocks in the output grid

### Quarry Crafting

### Mining Mechanics
- The quarry mines in a **square area** centered on itself, going straight down
- **Mining speed** depends on pickaxe type:
  - Golden pickaxes are fastest
  - Netherite and diamond are very efficient
  - Efficiency enchantment significantly increases speed
- **Durability** is consumed per block mined (reduced by Unbreaking)
- **Fuel** is consumed per block mined - different fuels mine different amounts of blocks

### ⚡ Fuel Efficiency
Here's how many blocks different fuels can mine:
- **Lava Bucket**: 100 blocks
- **Coal Block**: 80 blocks
- **Dried Kelp Block**: 20 blocks
- **Blaze Rod**: 12 blocks
- **Coal/Charcoal**: 8 blocks each
- **Wood/Planks**: 2 blocks per item
- **Sticks/Bamboo**: 1 block each

### 📦 Upgrading Your Quarry
1. Find a **Quarry Upgrade Template** in loot chests:
   - Bastions (30% chance - best source)
   - Stronghold libraries and corridors (20% chance)
   - Abandoned mineshafts (10% chance)
   - Nether fortresses (10% chance)
   - End cities (8% chance)
   - Desert pyramids (5% chance)
   - Dungeons and ruined portals (3% chance)

2. Place your Quarry block and one Upgrade Template in a crafting grid (shapeless)
3. Each upgrade increases mining width by 2 blocks

**Upgrade Progression**:
- **Level 0**: 5×5 (25 blocks per layer)
- **Level 1**: 7×7 (49 blocks per layer)
- **Level 2**: 9×9 (81 blocks per layer)
- **Level 3**: 11×11 (121 blocks per layer)
- **Level 4**: 13×13 (169 blocks per layer)
- **Level 5 (Max)**: 15×15 (225 blocks per layer)

### Automation Tips
- **Input fuel automatically**: Place a hopper on top pointing into the quarry
- **Extract items automatically**: Place a hopper underneath or use item pipes/ducts
- **Insert pickaxes**: Use hoppers on the sides for automatic pickaxe feeding
- **Monitor fullness**: Connect a comparator to detect when output inventory is full

### 💡 Pro Tips
- Use **Unbreaking III** pickaxes to significantly reduce pickaxe consumption
- **Fortune III** works perfectly - get extra diamonds, coal, redstone, etc.
- **Silk Touch** is supported - collect grass blocks, stone, ores as-is
- **Efficiency V** dramatically increases mining speed
- Keep the quarry **chunk-loaded** for continuous operation while you're away
- Upgrade to 15×15 for maximum efficiency - it mines 9x more blocks per layer than the base quarry
- Clear lava pools above the quarry area if you don't want fluids in your shaft
